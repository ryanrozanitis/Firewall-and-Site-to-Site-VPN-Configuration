# Firewall-and-Site-to-Site-VPN-Configuration
A project I completed at NJIT. Goes over how to set up pfSense firewalls in a client-server relationship over the internet.

## About
This project uses 4 VMs created in VirtualBox, a client, a server, and 2 pfSense firewalls. The client and the server were on two different subnets. The client and the server were only allowed to communicate through a third, mock "Internet" subnet through the pfSense firewalls. Site to Site VPN can be configured in the pfSense firewalls.

The best way to go about using this project would be to donwload the paper and follow along with the instructions contained in the paper. You can use any Linux distibution, and you can go to [pfSense.com](https://www.pfsense.org/download/) to download the free firewall software.
